A particle simulator in 2D space. Its architecture is inspired in that of OceanParcels:

* a vector field
* a set of particles
* the transformations applied to the particles at every time step

A diffusion probabilistic model to test its suitability to be integrated in a Lagrangian particle simulator

A heurisitc implemented wiht OceanParcels that splits a cloud of particles to estimate its potential spillage points.
